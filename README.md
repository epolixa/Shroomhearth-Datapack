# Shroomhearth Datapack
## Bespoke datapack for the Shroomhearth Minecraft server

### Disclaimer
This datapack is explicitly created and maintained for the Shroomhearth Minecraft server. Use of this datapack outside of Shroomhearth is not intended or supported and there is no guarantee that it will work in other Minecraft worlds. The datapack includes a wide variety of different functionality, overriding certain files in the minecraft namespace while adding several namespaces of its own for different features. As such it is unlikely to be compatible with any other datapack. In addition, certain functionality is hard-coded to work within particular in-game coordinates or dimensions and may have adverse affects on your world. 
This repository exists primarily as a means for members of the Shroomhearth community to view and contribute to the datapack on their Minecraft server. Pull requests, issue reports or feature requests related to use-cases explicitly outside of Shroomhearth will not be recognized. 

### Setup
The Shroomhearth Datapack uses a range of scoreboard objectives to track player, entity and global values. 
These objectives can be easily setup by running: `/function shroomhearth:setup_all`
